## 💎 PRO PEARLS & EXPERT TIPS

### 💰 Pearl #1: The "Remaining Credits" Trick
**Why it works:** Much easier to track what you have LEFT than what you used
- **Start session:** "I have 50 credits"
- **End session:** "I now have 43 credits"  
- **System calculates:** You used 7 credits
- **No mental math required!** ✨

### 📝 Pearl #2: Session Notes Are GOLD
**Examples of great notes:**
- "Fixed login bug, added user dashboard, implemented auth"
- "Claude was faster for this CSS task than ChatGPT"
- "Spent too much time on minor styling - stick to functionality"
- "This session was super productive - 3 features in 1 hour"

### 📊 Pearl #3: Use Multiple Short Sessions
**Instead of:** One 4-hour session = 20 credits
**Do this:** Four 1-hour sessions = 5+5+5+5 credits
**Why:** Better tracking of what tasks cost the most

### 🏆 Pearl #4: Platform Battle Testing  
**Test same task across platforms:**
- **ChatGPT session:** "Build contact form" = 8 credits
- **Claude session:** "Build contact form" = 12 credits  
- **Result:** ChatGPT is more efficient for forms
- **Make data-driven decisions!**
