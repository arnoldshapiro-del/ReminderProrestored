2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "DevTracker Pro"
4. Check the "repo" permission box
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe

### **Netlify Personal Access Token**  
**What it's for:** Allows the app to create sites and deploy them for you
**How to get it:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens
2. Click "New access token"
3. Give it a name like "DevTracker Pro"
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe

### **Adding Tokens to Your App**
1. Go to your app settings (I'll add this feature soon)
2. Paste your GitHub token in the GitHub field
